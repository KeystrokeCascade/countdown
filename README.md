# School Countdown
A big countdown clock to be displayed on a little junk netbook I picked up at some point to show how long until graduation.

Can probably be used to count down to other occasions (there is a variable in the .js file), and has a secret redirect when the countdown hits 0 (currently set to Crab Rave).
